Classic Counter-Strike (2) skins, now implemented in CamoShop 2.0!

This is fundimentally a remake of [Sdvfdffdg's CSGO Camos pack](https://thunderstore.io/c/h3vr/p/sdvfdffdg/CSGO_Camos/) using Camoshop 2.0 (this means proper metallic shading rather than simple flat textures) and a HEAVY focus on optimization. This project was spurred on when I was investigating performance issues and found that the Crimson Web texture alone was **11.4 MB** in size- the recomended maximum size for individual textures is *500 KB*. This pack aims to have all of the individual camo textures under that amount.

All of the textures have been remade from stratch using the source textures and optmizied. This means that your Dopplers will shine and your Case Hardeneds will... uh gleam? Without your computer crashing from Out of Memory errors.

As this is using the 2.0 system, you may want to use the Camoshop advanced menu- by default each skin is set to only apply to the "metal" material- this may vary based on the gun. Play around with that menu if nothing seems to happen. You can also use that menu as a pattern system- it is now possible to create Blue Gems on your AKs. 

If you want to contact me, I can be found on the H3VR Homebrew Discord as @padgriffin. I will likely port more skins over in the future- let me know if you have any requests or problems.
